    "4. **Effect on Multicollinearity**:\n",
    "   - **Ridge Regression**: Ridge regression is effective in handling multicollinearity by shrinking the coefficients of correlated predictors towards each other. It reduces the impact of multicollinearity but does not perform variable selection.\n",

    "In summary, Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression differ primarily in the type of penalty they apply and their impact on the resulting models. Ridge regression tends to shrink coefficients towards zero without excluding predictors, while Lasso regression can produce sparse solutions with some coefficients set to exactly zero, leading to automatic feature selection. The choice between Ridge and Lasso regression depends on the specific characteristics of the data and the goals of the analysis.'''"

       "\"Yes, Lasso Regression can handle multicollinearity in the input features to some extent, although its approach differs from that of other regression techniques. Multicollinearity occurs when two or more predictor variables in a regression model are highly correlated with each other.\\n\\nHere's how Lasso Regression handles multicollinearity:\\n\\n1. **Variable Selection**:\\n   - Lasso Regression includes a penalty term in its objective function that encourages sparsity in the coefficient vector.

    "'''Selecting the optimal value of the regularization parameter, often denoted as lambda (λ), in Lasso Regression involves a process called hyperparameter tuning. Here are some common methods to choose the optimal lambda:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Cross-Validation**: One of the most popular methods is k-fold cross-validation. You split your dataset into k equal parts, train the model on k-1 parts, and validate it on the remaining part. Repeat this process k times, each time using a different part as the validation set. Calculate the average performance metric (e.g., mean squared error) across all folds for each lambda value, and choose the one with the best performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Grid Search**: This method involves specifying a list of lambda values to try, then training the model with each value and evaluating it using cross-validation. The lambda value that gives the best performance is selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Random Search**: Similar to grid search, but instead of trying every possible value in a grid, you randomly sample lambda values from a specified range. This can be more efficient than grid search, especially for large ranges of lambda values.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Regularization Path**: Some implementations of Lasso Regression provide a regularization path, which shows how the coefficients change for different values of lambda. You can visually inspect this path to identify the lambda value that leads to the sparsity you desire while maintaining good model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Information Criterion**: Criteria such as AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) or BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion) can be used to select the lambda that balances model complexity and goodness of fit. These criteria penalize the number of parameters in the model, encouraging simplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Validation Set**: You can also split your data into training, validation, and test sets. Train the model with different lambda values on the training set, select the lambda that performs best on the validation set, and finally evaluate the chosen model on the test set to estimate its performance on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each method has its advantages and drawbacks, and the choice may depend on factors like the size of your dataset, computational resources, and specific requirements of your problem. Cross-validation is generally a reliable method for hyperparameter tuning in Lasso Regression.'''"
